## Welcome!

Hello there, I'm Francisco Ferrerós and by the time beeing I am studing a Bachelor's Degree in Videogame Design and Development at the Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya, Barcelona - Spain. I'm currently on my second year of the career and in the sillabus Project II i was demanded to create a research about how to implement a Quest Manager for our RPG game projects.To help with the explanation you can find a slides presentation below.

## Introduction

First of all, what are quests? If you are here I sopose you already know that but, to refresh our memory, quests (within the scope of videogames) are tasks or demands that players get in a certain point of a game, that if they complete, usualy, they get a reward in exchange. Lots of game progresions are based on the completion of the game's quests due that the rewards of the quest, usualy are upgrades for the player, money, history progress or other main pillars on the game's progression.

As you can see, due to the importance of the quests in videogames, it is very common that games don't have one quest but lots of them. If we are supposed to manage that in terms of code, to help us, here is where quest managers enter in the scene. Quest managers are the ones that lead the quests of a game. They manage the saves of the quests and their states, they update the quests and they trigger them when they are supposed to.

## Creating your quest manager

So, now you know that you need a quest manager, but wher you should start? Before starting to code anything, you must plan how you whant your game quest system to be so lets get into it.

### Quest System

The quest system consist in how the quests are implemented in your game. Are you planing to have a main storyline of quests and then secondary quests that pop up douring the playthrough. Or perhaps you only whant a system without the quests visible in game but use the quest manager to trak the progress of the player. Here you must think depply on what type of game is yours but there are some things to take into account when planing the quest system:

1.  **Importance:** what is the role of the quests in your game? Are they just a way to trak progression, does the player upgarde by completing them, there is a story questline or are they just play a secondary role in the game?
2.  **Generation:** how 
3.  
4.  **Relations:** what other systems is our quest manager relatid with such as a _Dialogue system, Events System, NPC's System, Game World, etc_.
